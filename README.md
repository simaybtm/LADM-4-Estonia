# LADM-4-Estonia
**Repository for the thesis**: "Leveraging BIM/IFC for Spatial Plan Registration and Compliance Checks for Permitting in Estonia, based on LADM Part 5: Spatial Plan Information."

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources for the thesis, focusing on developing a BIM/IFC-based compliance checking framework for spatial plans in Estonia. It leverages the ISO standard LADM Part 5 - Spatial Plan Information, providing a standardized approach for managing spatial data and performing compliance checks. The content includes database setup scripts, FME workflows, IFC datasets, and additional tools used in the research.

## Repository Contents

- **Research report**: The final research report detailing the methodology, case study, and findings.
- **Database scripts**: SQL scripts for setting up the LADM-based database.
- **FME workflows**: FME scripts for importing and managing IFC data.
- **IFC datasets**: Example datasets used in the Estonia case study.
- **Machine learning tools**: Scripts for performing additional spatial data analysis.

## Case Study

The repository supports the case study detailed in the thesis, which involves applying the framework to Estonia's spatial plan system. The system demonstrates how LADM Part 5 can be integrated with BIM and IFC to improve the efficiency and reliability of compliance checks for urban development projects.
